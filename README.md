Matlab-Simulink
===============

This is only a prototype to better understand repositories used as a source of documentation for Matlab and Simulink. Though Mathworks has admittedly the best documentation i've ever seen, this will only be served as a file sharing medium for code that users develop and use for future reference. Essentially, this repo will be used for showing examples.

This will also be used to better users in online repositories (Github), documentation, file sharing, and coopertively using this to develop code.
